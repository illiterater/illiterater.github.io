<p>Basic premise: free drug concentration at the target tissue of action will determine the magnitude and the duration of drug response</p>
<p>phase 1 enzymes metabolism: through the processes of oxidation, reduction or carboxylation</p>
<p>phase 2 enzymes conjugate make the phase 1 metabolites more water soluble</p>
<p><strong>key objectives for collecting PK from FiH trials</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To discern the given dose and schedule provide effective level of systemic exposure</li>
<li>To evaluate PK/PD variability</li>
<li>To assess the relationship between exposure and toxicity&amp;efficacy</li>
<li>To predict DDI</li>
</ul>

<td>Reference standards</td>
<td>A reference standard is a chemical substance of known purity and identity which is used to prepare calibration standards and quality controls. Three types of reference standards are usually used: (1) certified (e.g., USP compendial standards), (2) commercially supplied, and (3) custom-synthesized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Calibration curve</td>
<td>The calibration curve—also known as the standard curve—is the relationship between the instrument response and the calibration standards within the intended quantitation range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quality control samples(QCs)</td>
<td>Calibrators, or calibration standards, refer to a biological matrix to which a known amount of analyte has been added. Calibration standards are used to construct calibration curves from which the concentrations of analytes in QC samples and PK samples are determined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Selectivity &amp; specificity</td>
<td>Selectivity is the extent to which the method can determine a particular compound in the analyzed matrices without interference from matrix components. Specificity is the ability of the method to assess, unequivocally, the analyte in the presence of other components that are expected to be present (e.g., impurities, degradation products, matrix components, etc.).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sensitivity</td>
<td>Sensitivity is defined as the lowest analyte concentration in the matrix that can be measured with acceptable accuracy and precision (i.e., LLOQ).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Accuracy &amp; precision</td>
<td>Accuracy is the degree of closeness of the determined value to the nominal or known true value under prescribed conditions. Accuracy is also sometimes termed trueness. Precision is the closeness of agreement (i.e., degree of scatter) among a series of measurements obtained from multiple sampling of the same homogenous sample under the prescribed conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Recovery</td>
<td>Recovery refers to the extraction efficiency of an analytical process, reported as a percentage of the known amount of an analyte carried through the sample extraction and processing steps of the method.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stability of the analyte in the matrix</td>
<td>Stability is a measure of the intactness an analyte (lack of degradation) in a given matrix under specific storage and use conditions relative to the starting material for given time intervals.</td>

<p><strong>DDI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In vitro
<ul>
<li>understanding the principal routes of the drug’s elimination</li>
<li>identifying the enzymes and transporters involved in drug disposition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1st step: determine if the investigational drug is a substrate of metabolizing enzymes
<ul>
<li>
<p>routinely evaluated in in vitro phenotyping studies include CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>additional enzymes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CYP2A6, CYP2J2, CYP4F2 and CYP2E1</li>
<li>phase I enzymes: monoamine oxidase (MAO), Flavin monooxygenase (FMO), xanthine oxidase (XO) and alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase</li>
<li>phase II enzymes: uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a specific metabolizing enzyme is responsible for &gt;25% of the drug’s elimination, then clinical DDI 
studies should be performed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2nd step: evaluate the potential of the investigational drug to inhibit (reversible inhibition or time-dependent inhibition) or induce the major metabolizing enzymes
<ul>
<li>If the predicted ratio of AUC of a sensitive index substrate drug in the presence and absence of the investigation drug is ≤0.8 or ≥1.25 based on static mechanistic models, clinical DDI studies should be conducted using a sensitive index substrate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clinical DDI study: Using a strong index perpetrator or sensitive substrate helps to create the “worst-case scenario” to evaluate the possible greatest magnitude of DDI
<ul>
<li>strong, moderate and weak inhibitor increases the AUC of a sensitive index substrate by ≥5-fold, ≥2- to &lt;5-fold, and ≥1.25- to &lt;2-fold, respectively.</li>
<li>strong, moderate and or weak inducer decreases the AUC of a sensitive index substrate by ≥ ≥80 percent, ≥50 to &lt;80 percent, or by ≥20 to &lt;50 percent, respectively.</li>
