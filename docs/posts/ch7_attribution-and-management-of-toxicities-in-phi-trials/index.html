<p>In clinical research, <strong>attribution</strong> is the determination of whether a clinical event is related to the investigational treatment under study, or non-treatment causes, such as the underlying disease, or comorbidities. it is also referred to as “relatedness to study treatment” in published reports or as “causality” in certain regulatory contexts</p>
<ul>
<li>In early-stage development, the use of attribution data is for safety assessment to ensure patient protection</li>
<li>In later stages of development, the safety profile of an investigational drug is usually completed with key toxicities of special interest and less attention is paid to mild and expected adverse events</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different causality reporting requirements between the FDA and EMA</p>
<ul>
<li>FDA ultimately requires sponsors to make the causality determination for an AE.
<ul>
<li>For SAE, attributions have to be made by the PI and the PI must report to the sponsor, regardless of attribution.</li>
<li>if the SAE is serious, unexpected, suspected, regardless of attribution/causality, sponsor should expedite reporting of the SAE to the FDA .</li>
<li>Either the investigator or the sponsor can make the determination that an AE is serious.</li>
<li>At the site, all SAEs have to be reported to the sponsor by the site investigator, regardless of whether the SAE is considered drug-related or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>According to EMA ICH E2A, AE causality is determined by either the investigator or the sponsor</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding trials sponsored by <strong>NCI-CTEP</strong>, a source document called the Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (<strong>CAEPR</strong>), is provided and serves as a guide to the investigator and is a way of determining what toxicities have been seen with a specific drug.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and inefficiencies with symptom attribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Misattribution due to confounding factors (prior therapies, comorbidities, multiagent studies)</li>
<li>Insufficient baseline information</li>
<li>Trial logistics, cost and time</li>
<li>Lack of education on attribution</li>
<li>Lack of communication between regulators, investigators and sponsors</li>
<li>Inconsistent publication of safety reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Two- and 3-tier systems have been proposed</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2-tier system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>more likely related to study drug (than other causes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more likely related to other causes (than study drug)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>3-tier system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>more likely related to study drug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>equally likely related to study drug and other causes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more likely related to other causes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notifications</p>
<ul>
<li>baseline scores and pretrial data important</li>
<li>long-term data, including low-grade AEs</li>
<li>patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and PRO-CTCAE</li>
<li>attribution in combinatorial studies should be focused on the combination regimen rather than to individual drugs</li>
</ul>
