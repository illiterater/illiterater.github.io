<p><em>Dose-response-toxicity relationship curves and therapeutic window for CHTs. The dose-response curve for traditional CHTs follows a sigmoidal shape, slowly rising until a minimum efficacy threshold is met (minimum efficacious dose, MED), followed by a linear phase that then reaches a plateau. The antitumor activity occurs in the linear phase, although extreme doses of CHT do not translate into higher activity rates once the plateau phase is reached; on the contrary, they might correlate with toxicity towards normal tissues (maximum tolerated dose, MTD). The therapeutic window is the range of doses comprised in the area where the curves separate, and comprises those doses that achieve the greatest therapeutic benefit without resulting in unacceptable side effects. ADC technology offers the possibility of widening this therapeutic window and efficaciously targeting selected antigen-expressing cancer cells</em></p>

<p><em>Dose-response-toxicity relationship curves and integration of effect markers for defining 
the  biologically  effective  dose  (BED)  of  a  certain  MTA.  The  traditional  CHT  dose-response- 
toxicity sigmoidal curves have been reshaped with this second paradigm in EDD: very low doses 
of a MTA might be sufficient for hitting the desired target. Two scenarios can occur at higher 
doses: either sustained efficacy once the target modulation has reached a plateau (dotted red line), 
or a progressive decrease in clinical benefit due to loss of selectivity (straight red line). Toxicity 
might occur at very high doses or might never occur, and in certain occasions, the MTD may not 
be reached with traditional toxicity-guiding escalation designs (blue curve). Hence, to define an 
optimal BED, many markers of effect, pharmacodynamics, toxicity or radiological markers should 
be integrated into novel Ph1 designs developing MTAs</em></p>

<p>at higher doses, efficacy may not increase and selectivity may even be lost, with off-target toxicities</p>

<p><em>Overall survival (OS) curve and probability of severe G3-5 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with ICT mAbs. In the case of rapidly progressing malignancies with high tumor growth rates, Kaplan Meier curves for OS with ICT mAbs typically show a rapid decrease during the first months of therapy, then enter a slowly descending curve (red line). Those patients who benefit from the ICT mAb and survive beyond 24 months tend to reach a plateau and may represent a tail of long-term survivors. Most of the G3-5 irAEs described with ICT mAbs appear within the first 3–6 months of the start of therapy, with no clear linear dose-dependent relationship. ICT mAbs are generally safe, although gastrointestinal colitis or diarrhea (light blue line), endocrine toxicity (lilac line), skin-rash or pruritus (dark blue line), and liver toxicity (turquoise line) are among the most common irAEs, with maximum reported rates for all tumor types in the main clinical trials for anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 ICT mAbs of around 12%, 4%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Although irAEs are unpredictable and can occur at any time during the administration of these drugs, a peculiar pattern has been observed, as illustrated in this figure. Although most of these severe irAEs can be solved completely with early detection and adequate medication, a delayed response to the ICT mAb cannot be excluded even 1 year after starting administration, and oncologists must keep such responses in mind during the follow-up of exposed patients (dotted lines). Immune-related endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency) tend to occur later during the treatment, but in most of cases, patients will require permanent hormone replacement</em></p>
