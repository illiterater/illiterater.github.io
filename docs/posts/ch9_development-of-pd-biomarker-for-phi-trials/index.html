<p>PD biomarkers are molecular indicators of the drug’s effect on the target in an organism</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Based on the understanding of molecular biology of cancer and the role of the tumor environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be used to examine the link between a drug treatment, the target effects, and a biological tumor response</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for selecting the optimal population</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually lack of standardization and validation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Growing interest in PD biomarkers in phase I</p>
<ul>
<li>potential ability to correlate clinical data with target modulation</li>
<li>combine functional information with early assessment of tumor response</li>
<li>seek molecular and biochemical evidence of on-target engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>determination of “proof-of-mechanism”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optimal source of tissue for collecting PD biomarkers in human</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitability of biomarkers as surrogate endpoints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>convenience of looking at one single analyte or measuring proteins in close functional proximity to the target</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether maximal target inhibition is indeed desirable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>key questions  for use PD biomarker in targeted drug  development</p>
<ul>
<li>defining the biologically optimal dose and schedule for phase II studies</li>
<li>their use as surrogate endpoints of drug resistance, clinical toxicity or efficacy</li>
<li>their clinical utility for defining the population likely to respond to the drug</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pharmacological Audit Trail (PhAT)</strong></p>
<p>A framework of questions that should be answered during the process of developing a new drug to identify how much of the drug reaches a given location and the biological effect in the target tissue</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/03/09/5O3TGmKqh8I9caE.png" alt="PhAT"></p>
<p>in step 3</p>
<ul>
<li>proof-of-mechanism PD biomarkers: when they measure the effect of the drug against a certain target or pathway</li>
<li>proof-of-concept biomarkers: when they show later effects on a hallmark cancer pathway, such a proliferation or angiogenesis.  “functional consequences”</li>
<li>intermediate endpoints of clinical response:  address the issue of whether the drug actually achieves the intended clinical effect, include
<ul>
<li>changes in tumor markers</li>
<li>circulating tumor cell (CTC) numbers</li>
<li>changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)</li>
<li>fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PhAT is intended to guide the process of decision-making during drug development.</p>
<p>Phase I clinical trials are the optimal scenario for showing proof-of-mechanism with PD biomarkers. Incorporated proof-of-concept PD biomarkers in “extended and stratified phase I trials” together with surrogate endpoints such as radiological response and progression-free survival</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>FDA:  biomarkers used in the approval of a drug include both the biomarker and the context of use (COU). COU is  “a statement that fully and clearly describes the how the biomarker is to be used and its purpose of use”</p>
<p>FDA qualification process involves three stages</p>
<ul>
<li>initiation stage: letter send to Biomarker Qualification Review Team (BQRT)</li>
<li>consultation stage: FDA experts give recommendations or suggest meeting</li>
<li>review stage: full package of supporting evidence send to BQRT</li>
</ul>
<p>FDA only published 20 biomarkers</p>
<p>Alternative and common approach:  include the potential biomarker in IND&amp;NDA application</p>
<p>COU statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the identity of the biomarker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the aspect of the biomarker that is measured and the form in which it is used for biological interpretation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the characteristics of the subjects studied</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the purpose of its use in drug development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the drug development circumstances for applying the biomarker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the interpretation and decision/action based on the biomarker</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>recommendations for the process of biomarker development</p>
<ul>
<li>analytical validation, biomarker tests need to present internal validity, including reliability, reproducibility and maintain adequate sensitivity and specificity</li>
<li>qualification, biomarker qualification requires both evidence of <em>a link between the treatment and the biomarker</em> and <em>between biomarker changes and changes on clinical endpoints of interest</em></li>
<li>a defined utilization setting</li>
</ul>
<p>If a biomarker will have a dual use, such as for <strong>enrichment of the target patient</strong> and eventually as <strong>companion diagnostic</strong>, it would have to follow FDA additional requirements.</p>
<p>EMA biomarker qualification process</p>
<ul>
<li>first step (not mandatory): submitter ask for Qualification Advice by sending a package</li>
<li>EMA may publish a Letter of Support subject to the fulfillment of certain requirements</li>
<li>Qualification Opinion can be requested by submitting a dossier with the scientific evidence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fit-for-purpose</strong> biomarker validation is based on the idea that the stringency of the evaluation process should depend on the intended use of the biomarker.</p>
<p><strong>Model-Based Drug Development</strong></p>
<p>Traditional clinical trial design typically uses a pre-specified set of assumptions derived from observations from previous studies.</p>
<p>Model-Based drug development  expresses the predicted outcomes as a mathematical systems and then uses an iterative process to test the model against the data using a learn-predict-confirm approach</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/03/09/vGdRc2A8WotbBZK.png" alt="MBDD"></p>
<p><strong>Neoadjuvant Setting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>correlate PD biomarkers with surrogates of clinical activity</li>
<li>comparing baseline and post-treatment tumor samples allow identification of any changes in PD biomarkers without additional interventions</li>
<li>example: select HER2-positive breast cancer subpopulation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Window-of-Opportunity(WOO) Studies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To explore PD biomarkers and early surrogates of potential antitumoral activity</li>
<li>Treatment duration is short and not have a therapeutic intent</li>
<li>In patients with early-stage disease receive the drug for a brief period of time, before undergoing surgical treatment
<ul>
<li>treatment naïve patient</li>
<li>opportunity to observe and characterize better the effects of the drug</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Considerations
<ul>
<li>initial toxicity profile must be well established</li>
<li>should demonstrate some efficacy in the advanced-disease setting</li>
<li>strong rationale to include the specific population</li>
<li>risk of delaying or compromising curative treatment should be minimal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pharmacodynamic-biomarker-approaches">Pharmacodynamic Biomarker Approaches</h3>
<h4 id="tissue-based-biomarkers">Tissue-based biomarkers</h4>
<p>Tumor specimens is the gold standard</p>
<p>PD biomarkers explored in tumor samples include</p>
<ul>
<li>protein markers of cell signaling</li>
<li>cellular proliferation/apoptosis</li>
<li>cell-cycle regulation biomarkers</li>
<li>epigenetic changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitation</p>
<ul>
<li>potential variability in drug exposure</li>
<li>inter- and intratumor heterogeneity</li>
<li>feasibility, ethic and costs</li>
</ul>
<p>key for estimating (BRAF-mutant melanoma as example)</p>
<ul>
<li>degree of target engagement</li>
<li>its functional consequences</li>
</ul>
<p>potential surrogate biomarker (skin biopsies for EGFR inhibitors as example )</p>
<ul>
<li>skin, peripheral blood mononucleat cells (PBMCs) and plucked hair follicles</li>
<li>can provide insights into target inhibition (as a proof-of-mechanism) and the time course/duration of such effects</li>
<li>not always be assumed that the effects of the drug on the tumor and the surrogate tissue will be identical
<ul>
<li>different drug penetration between the surrogate tissue and the tumor tissue</li>
<li>variations in key gene expression</li>
<li>absence of somatic mutations in the oncogenic target in normal tissues</li>
<li>differences in drug metabolism</li>
<li>differences in terms of regulation of the signal transduction pathway</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="circulating-biomarkers-ctcs-and-ctdna">Circulating Biomarkers: CTCs and ctDNA</h4>
<p>less-invasive, factors that influence biomarker testing are better understood and characterized, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>markers of tumor cell death</li>
<li>unbound physiological ligands and soluble receptors</li>
<li>changes in peripheral immune cell subpopulations</li>
</ul>
<p>Two reliable modalities of circulating biomarkers, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CellSEARCH system is the only FDA-validated method  to quantify CTCs</p>
<ul>
<li>uses EpCAM-based immunomagnetic isolation and fluorescent staining</li>
<li>for cytokeratins, CD45 and an additional marker to enumerate and characterize CTCs</li>
<li>rely on the presence of these epithelial markers on the surface of the CTC</li>
<li>limits its utility in tumor types for which such surface expression is absent or lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ctDNA in the blood  following necrosis or apoptosis of cancer cells</p>
<ul>
<li>more accurately the genomic and spatial heterogeneity of the tumor than current CTC methods</li>
<li>implicit bias might occur in assessing treatment-resistant clones that undergo less apoptosis</li>
<li>ability to detect changes in tumor dynamics (detect treatment- resistant clone)</li>
<li>inability to detect functional changes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="image-based-biomarkers">Image-based biomarkers</h4>
<p>PET-CT and MRI with perfusion and diffusion techniques</p>
<ul>
<li>advantages: less invasive and safer than a tumor biopsy</li>
<li>disadvantages: cost, technical complexity, use of ionizing radiation in some cases</li>
<li>be used to measure direct drug-target engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined conventional FDG-PET with a radiolabeled-PARP inhibitor was used to show a correlation between drug distribution in the tumor tissue with a decrease in the metabolic activity of the tumor. MRI can measure drug perfusion or as an early marker of response.</p>
<h4 id="changing-landscape-immunotherapy-and-beyond">Changing Landscape: Immunotherapy and Beyond</h4>
<p>Achieving a response with immunotherapy requires both an <strong>immunogenic tumor</strong> (in some instances associated with a high tumoral mutational burden), as well as a <strong>competent immune system</strong>(that could be exemplified by a T cell inflamed gene expression profile).</p>
<p><strong>Paired tumor biopsies</strong> have becomingly increasingly standard in early clinical trials with immunotherapy</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>changes in the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells</strong> and <strong>transcriptional changes</strong> seem to offer high potential for a role as immunotherapy PD biomarkers</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic changes in soluble biomarkers</strong> such as CD25 and IL-2 and circulating immune subpopulations including CD8 and NK are also being used to design rational immunotherapy combinations</li>
<li>PD-L1 can be characterized in CTCs where it seems to be highly upregulated as a mechanism to overcome immune-vigilance
<ul>
<li>high levels of PD-L1 expression in CTCs after treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor was associated with worse long-term outcomes in patients with NSCLC</li>
<li>changes in surface biomarkers associated with the immune response in liquid biopsies have the potential to become biomarkers for immunotherapy</li>
</ul>
</li>
